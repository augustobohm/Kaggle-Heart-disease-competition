# Kaggle Heart disease competition

One of my first projects in Kaggle. By the time i started, the competition was already closet, so i don't have any score for the cometition.

The best single model i have obtained during the competition was a Logistic Regression model with a train accuracy score of 87.18 and test accuracy score of 86.14. After that i used StandardScale to standardize the independent features present in the data in a fixed range. The result was an increase of the accuracy of models not based on Decision tree. In this case, the KNeighbors model had the same train accuracy of Logistic Regression without the Standardization and test accuracy inreased to 88.14.
